    "Welcome to the project of Finding Donors for CharilityML! This project is based on the *Finding Donors for CharityML Project* in the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at Udacity Online Course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009#).\n",

    "In this project, several supervised algorithms are employed to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results is chosen and optimized to best model the data. The goal is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 or less.This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, this value can be infered from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. The article by Ron Kohavi can be seen online [here](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data investigated consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.\n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so the values must be translated by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. This feature is then encoded into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML* knows that individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. **F-beta score** can be used as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since one can say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since any information to substantiate the claim is not considered. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for the data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: *if all people made less than \\$50,000,* CharityML *would identify no one as donors.*\n",

    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "***Recap in the context of spam emails***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** indicates what proportion of messages is classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",

    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in this case. For example, if 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. 90 messages could be classified as not spam (including the 2 that were spam but classified as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam (all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score (the harmonic mean is taken as deat with ratios).\n"

    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "Decision Trees can be applied into many cases. For instance, one can use them to \"identify the relationships between a household and its electricity consumptions in Hong Kong\" (http://what-when-how.com/artificial-intelligence/decision-tree-applications-for-data-modelling-artificial-intelligence/, 12.03.2018, 6:53pm)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Decision Trees requires little preparation, easy to understand, as one can easily draw the tree for visualisation, its data prediction is logarithmic \"in the number of data points used to train the tree\" (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html). One can also easily find which features are more significant than others, so it is usefull in data exploration. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "The weakness of the model lies in its tendency to overfit. A solution would be the Random Forest model that averages the different outputs of several Trees with limited features.\n",
    "It does perform poorly also on continuous variables as one has to 'split' the feature as (<= 5 or >5) or more. They are also sensitive to small variations as for instance, (<=8 and >8) is different from the previous example, thus giving a different tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "Decision Trees are efficient to binary problems, also it can manage continous variables. But the problem may come from the numerous dummy variables that we generated thus the model may overfit. \n",

    "One real-world application of Ensemble Method is to face and/or voice recognition. In this paper (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5178708, 12.04.2018, 3.20pm), they use ensemble method to obtain a higher recognition rate than other individual classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "Compared to a single estimator, the differents ensemble method reduces either the variance or the bias (but not both). Whereas the single estimator would have either a high variance or a high bias. Bagging for example reduces the variance but not the bias whereas Boosting reduces the bias but keeping the variance high (Eun Bae Kong and Thomas G. Dietterich. _Error-correcting output coding corrects bias and variance_. In Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 313–321, 1995)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "The performance of the model can be reduced if there are lots of noises or if there aren't real 'pattern classification'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",
    "This model can search for patterns between individual features that can be used by the weak learners and thus gives good results. Moreover, the dummy variables may help here as weak learners need not to be necessarily good.\n",

    "**_Support Vector Machines_**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe one real-world application in industry where the model can be applied. \n",
    "A real-world application is in bioinformatics. SVM is used to identifiy the classification of genes, patients on the basis of genes and other biological problems (https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/, 12.04.2018, 4.41pm)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "The model is very effective on non-linear boundaries (as seen during lectures) and works efficiently when a fair margin is recognizable. SVM's are also very robust against overfitting particularly when datas are in high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "The model doesn't perform well if the kernely aren't chosen correctly. Thus it is time and memory consuming to find the right kernel (https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms, 12.05.2018, 12.44pm)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes this model a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data?\n",

    "According the the cell above, AdaBoost seems to be the most efficient as its accuracy and fscore are the highest on the testing sets when 100%, 10% and 1% of the training set are used. Moreover, one can observe an increase on both metrics for Adaboost (actually on all three models) when one's using more and more training datas. The prediction time for SVC is the longest between all three but Adaboost seems to have a constant (approximately) time of predictions on the testing set. Also, the Adaboost model is particularly efficient on binary classification problems as it is the case of this problem. The model to be used is then Adaboost."

    "This model uses several small classifiers in order to find our final model. First, the small classifiers uses a random part of the dataset, called the 'training set'. The small classifiers are used one after another until all of them are used. Of course they will misclassify some points but that is okay as there are several small classifiers that will classify them afterwards. At each small classification, the boundary that classified the points as positive ('earns more than 50K') and negative ('earns less or equal than 50K') and the label of each area ('positive' or 'negative') are stored. At the end, the imposition of those boundaries gives us the final model. An area is considered 'positive' if it was labelled more often 'positive' than 'negative'. An area is considered 'negative' if it was labelled more often 'negative' than 'positive'.\n",
