# Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield for a fictitious charity organization, while also reducing the total number of letters being sent to ask for donations. This fictitious charity organization is CharityML located in the heart of Silicon Valley and was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning.

This project is based on the [Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). It is designed to gain experience with supervised learning algorithms, preprocessing technics, evaluating learners, model optimization and so on.

## Project Highlights
This project contains three files:

    finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where the project is performed.
    census.csv: The project dataset to be loaded in the notebook.
    visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)(v0.17)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

The softwares will need to be installed and ready to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If Python is not installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Starting the Project
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with the notebook. Alternatively, the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook can be used and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens.
